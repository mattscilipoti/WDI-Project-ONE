# GA: WDI | Project One | JS Flash Cards

## About

This is the first project at WDI.

I chose to do flash cards.

### User Stories

1. Users should see a rendered flash card

2. Once the question is presented, the user should have the option to
reveal the answer.

3. Users should be able to skip a card.

4. Cards that are skipped but not removed go to the back of the deck

5. Cards that are still in the deck should continue to cycle from start to finish

6. Cards should have the ability to be removed.

7. Users should be able to see how many cards make up the deck, as well as how many still remain if any have been removed

### Process & Planning

This project was pretty straight forward.

Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery.

Pre-plans:

1. I thought the flow of the final product should mimic that of what you experience when you actually have a deck of prewritten index cards in your hand.

2. Next, I drew sketches on paper.
