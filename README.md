# GA: WDI | Project One | JS Flash Cards

## About

This is the first project at WDI.

I chose to do flash cards.

### User Stories

1. Users should see a rendered flash card

2. Once the question is presented, the user should have the option to
reveal the answer.

3. Users should be able to skip a card.

4. Cards that are still in the deck should continue to cycle from start to finish

6. users should be able to come up on a card, then reveal the back of the card.
