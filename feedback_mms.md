## Overview:

Looks great!  I bet writing all these questions helped you learn javascript.  One of my first programs was a flashcard game for my latin vocab.  I learned a lot about both doing that.

You coded a working game after only two weeks of coding.  That's pretty cool.

User stories competed?  Check!  You executed well and didn't reach too far.

Your readem, files, and code are well organized.  A joy to review.

Keep up the good work.

## Rubric:

* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

    **Exceeds Expectations**. Superb readme.  Nice and clear user stories.  Awesome process.  Kudos.

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

    **Meets Expectations** We're only two weeks in!  This is a marked improvement over your other work.  I'm happy to see it.  The use of arrow keys was a nice touch.

* __Creativity__: Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

    **Exceeds expectations** From the readme, to the questions, to the code, your personality shines through.  Kudos.

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

    **Meets expectations** Good job.  Well organized, clean logic, nicely commented.  Review my code comments in this [Pull Request](https://github.com/RoselPadilla/WDI-Project-ONE/pull/1) (prefixed with my initials - "mms").

* __Problem Solving__: Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations? _(Note that this part of your feedback evaluation will take place during your one-on-one code review with your instructors, after you've completed the project.)_

    **3: Exceeds expectations** Clean and simple.  Great user experience. If you take out the data, it's around 80 lines of code.

Good job.  Keep it up.  You're on the right track.
